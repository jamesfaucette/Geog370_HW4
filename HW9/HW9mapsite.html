    <h1>Homework 9: A map of total deer harvested in Georgia by county.</h1>
    <h2>JT Faucette</h2>
    <h3>This map topic was inspired by roommate, Ryan, an avid hunter and country boy. The dataset I used was provided by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. I decided to use natural breaks in classifying the data in order to highlight the especially prolific deer hunting counties. I also chose my colors in order to do this. The "Magma" gradient in QGIS created a heatmap-like appearance. I decided to forego both a North and a scale as my choropleth is not intended to accurately show directions or distances, just deer.  </h3>
